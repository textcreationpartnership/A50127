            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Wilt thou know, O vain man, That Faith without Works is Dead?</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THAT Great Preacher of the Gospel, and <hi>Insatiable Admirer of the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> our Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in all his Writings, but especially in the Epistle, which he wrote unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> [which was by <hi>Melancthon</hi> well called, <hi>The Protestants Confession of Faith,</hi>] as well as his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> does abundantly maintain this Article of our <hi>Faith, That a man is not Justified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ. <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith</hi>
               </hi> is a Receiving of, and a Relying on, the <hi>Gift of Righteousness</hi> from God, by our Lord Jesus Christ; or, the Consent of a Distressed Soul, to be <hi>Justified,</hi> by Gods <hi>Graciously Imputing</hi> unto him, the <hi>Obedience</hi> which the Lord Jesus Christ, as our <hi>Surety,</hi> yielded unto God, on the behalf of His Elect. This <hi>Faith</hi> doth <hi>Justify</hi> a Sinner, not <hi>as</hi> it is a <hi>Work;</hi> but <hi>Organically</hi> &amp; <hi>Relatively;</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as it is the <hi>Instrument,</hi> by which a man apprehends the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, as freely Tendred unto the Sinner in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49234:3"/> Gospel; Tis only in this Regard, that <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; no <hi>Grace,</hi> but <hi>this Faith,</hi> ha's the Honour to <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy</hi> us. This is the <hi>Good old way,</hi> of arriving unto <hi>Rest;</hi> and, <hi>Aliter qui Vadit, cadit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But every <hi>Jewel</hi> ha's a <hi>Counterfeit.</hi> And, <hi>How shall a man know, that his Faith in the Righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, for his Justification, is not a Counterfeit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To answer that Case, the Blessed Apostle <hi>James,</hi> under the <hi>Inspirations of the Almighty,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares unto us, the <hi>Marks</hi> of a <hi>Justifying Faith;</hi> and those <hi>Marks</hi> are, the <hi>Works</hi> which it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually disposes the Believer unto.</p>
            <p>Now among the Admonitions of the Apostle to this purpose, there is a special Remark due to that, <hi>Wilt thou know, O vain man, that Faith without works is Dead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reader will presently observe in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable passage; both the Character of the <hi>Faith,</hi> which does not produce and promote <hi>Good Works,</hi> in the <hi>man</hi> that hath it: It is a <hi>Dead Faith;</hi> it will be of no use unto the man in whom it is; it can do nothing for him: and then, the Character of the <hi>Man</hi> who ha's this <hi>Faith;</hi> He is a <hi>vain man;</hi> he seems, and he boasts, to <hi>have,</hi> what he hath <hi>not;</hi> and he flatters himself with <hi>Hopes</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall be made Good unto him. So that, we are now Assured, <hi>A Workless Faith is a Workless Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul,</hi> who Professedly handles the Doctrine of <hi>Justification,</hi> does plainly assert, That no man
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49234:3"/> living is <hi>Justified</hi> by <hi>Works,</hi> but a man is <hi>Justifyed</hi> only by <hi>Faith. James</hi> does nevertheless assert, That a man is <hi>Justified</hi> by <hi>Works,</hi> and a man is not <hi>Justified</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> only. And yet, however some of the Ancients, as well as <hi>Luther,</hi> stumbled at this <hi>Appearance of Contradiction,</hi> the Assertions do not Contradict one another at all. <hi>Paul</hi> treats of our <hi>Justification</hi> before <hi>God,</hi> and the Right unto Everlasting Life, therein granted unto us, which is only by <hi>Faith</hi> in our Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>James</hi> treats of that which may manifest our <hi>Justification</hi> unto <hi>men,</hi> that See &amp; Hear, our Profession of our <hi>Faith;</hi> and here <hi>Works</hi> are significant. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> of a man, may be distressed with a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Accusation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, A man may be Accused of <hi>Iniquity;</hi> It may be said, <hi>Thou hast broken the Law, and thereby wronged the Name, of God, and the terrible penalty of that Law, now belongs unto thee.</hi> The Answer to this <hi>Accusation</hi> is to be, <hi>My Lord Jesus Christ ha's fully obey'd the will of God, and suffered the penalty due to me for my Disobedience; and I do by Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on this Righteousness of my Lord Jesus Christ, for my Acceptance with God for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, A man may be Accused of <hi>Hypocrisy;</hi> It may be said, <hi>Thou Talkest of thy Faith; but is it not meer Talk? How canst thou prove, that thy Faith is any more, than what is in the very Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</hi> The Answer to this <hi>Accusation</hi> is, <hi>The works of a Sanctified man, which I am doing every Day, are the Proof of my Faith.</hi> According hereunto it is asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49234:4"/> by <hi>Paul,</hi> That a man is <hi>Justified alone by Faith:</hi> but it is asserted by <hi>James,</hi> That a man is <hi>not Justified by a Faith which is alone.</hi> The Question discoursed by <hi>Paul</hi> is, <hi>How a Guilty Person may come to be Acquitted by the Lord, from all the Guilt that lies upon him?</hi> The Answer to this Question, is, Not by any <hi>Works</hi> of our own, but only by the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is, on our part, only by <hi>Faith</hi> applied unto us. The Question discoursed by <hi>James,</hi> is, <hi>Whether a man pretending to Faith in the Righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, shall be saved, though he continue without the works of an Holy Life, agreeable thereunto?</hi> The Answer to this Question is, <hi>No,</hi> Such a man ha's no <hi>Saving Faith</hi> at all. And that <hi>James</hi> is to be taken in that sense, is evident from This: He does insist upon the Instance of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was a <hi>Justified man,</hi> Thirty years, before those <hi>Works,</hi> which are said here to <hi>Justify</hi> him Upon the whole then, we see <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, or indeed, never contrdicting. And we are Advised after all; Tis a <hi>Vanity</hi> in any man to <hi>Profess,</hi> that he ha's a <hi>True Faith</hi> in the Lord Jesus Christ, if his <hi>Faith</hi> be not <hi>Fruitful</hi> in those <hi>Good Works,</hi> which may <hi>Justify</hi> the mans <hi>Profession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are Two very Important <hi>Cases,</hi> about which the Thoughts of every Christian, cannot but be Exercised; and we will here bestow some of our Thoughts thereupon.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>Case</hi> which a Christian, must Consider, if he would be a <hi>Christian,</hi> is,</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49234:4"/>
               <head>What are those <hi>Good Works,</hi> which a True Faith, will Quicken &amp; Incline the Believer unto?</head>
               <p>Now we may thus conceive of them; <hi>Good Works,</hi> are <hi>Sincere Essayes</hi> to observe the <hi>Law of God.</hi> Our God hath given us a <hi>Rule of Life,</hi> in that which we call, <hi>The Moral Law.</hi> None of our <hi>Works</hi> are <hi>Perfectly Good,</hi> if in any point they fall short of that <hi>Rule.</hi> But none of our <hi>Works</hi> do <hi>Perfectly</hi> come up to the <hi>Rule,</hi> as long as we are lodg'd in <hi>this Body which is to Dy.</hi> The <hi>Best men</hi> alive, when they look upon the <hi>Best Works</hi> of their Lives, may cry out, with one of the Ancients, <hi>Terret me tota vita mea, nam apparet mihi, aut Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum, aut tota Sterilitas;</hi> The <hi>Sinfulness,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranness,</hi> of all my <hi>Life,</hi> strikes me with a <hi>Deadly Terror</hi> of Soul! Nevertheless, there are <hi>Sincere Essays</hi> towards <hi>Perfection,</hi> which all Believers are Conscientiously making every Day. Now these <hi>Essayes</hi> are <hi>Good,</hi> in the Merciful Reckoning of God, our <hi>Father</hi> in our Lord Jesus Christ. Tho' none of our <hi>Sincere Essayes</hi> at <hi>Well-doing</hi> are such <hi>Good works</hi> as to <hi>Justify</hi> us, before that Thrice <hi>Holy God,</hi> who is of <hi>Purer eyes than to behold Evil,</hi> &amp; whose <hi>Pure Eyes</hi> yet <hi>behold</hi> in our <hi>Good Works,</hi> a world of <hi>Evil:</hi> Yet our <hi>Sincere Essayes</hi> are pleasing unto our God, who by His Good <hi>Spirit</hi> ha's Excited them, &amp; Assisted them; and, <hi>Whose workmanship we are, Created in Christ Jesus unto Good works, which God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them.</hi> Such Good <hi>Works,</hi> as our <hi>Prayers,</hi> are, as tis said, in Prov. 15.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49234:5"/>
                  <hi>The Delight of the Lord;</hi> and such Good <hi>Works,</hi> as our <hi>Alms,</hi> are, as tis said, in Heb. 13.16. <hi>The Sacrifices where-with God is well pleased.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, to speak strictly, <hi>Good Works</hi> must have these Four Ingredients to render them <hi>such.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First; The <hi>Matter</hi> of our <hi>Works</hi> must be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Law</hi> of God, or, His <hi>Will</hi> Revealed in His <hi>Word.</hi> The Prophet could say, in Mic. 6.8. <hi>He hath shewed thee, O man, the thing that is Good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to Do Justice, and to Love Mercy, and to walk Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with thy God. Good Works</hi> must be such, as the Lord hath <hi>shewn</hi> to us, that He hath <hi>Required</hi> of us. They are no <hi>Good Works,</hi> whereof our God may say, <hi>Who hath required 'em?</hi> Works of <hi>Piety,</hi> are <hi>Good Works;</hi> for we have the <hi>Word</hi> of our God for them; as in Psal. 92.1. <hi>It is a Good Thing to give Thanks unto the Lord.</hi> Works of <hi>Charity</hi> are <hi>Good Works;</hi> for we have the <hi>word</hi> of our God for them; as in Heb. 13.16. <hi>To Do Good, and to Communicate, forget not.</hi> No works are <hi>Good,</hi> but such as are contained in the <hi>Two Tables</hi> of the <hi>Ten Commandments;</hi> the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But unto the Constitution of <hi>Good Works,</hi> it is not enough, that the <hi>matter</hi> of what we do, be according to the <hi>Law</hi> of God. Men may do <hi>Works</hi> that shall be <hi>Good</hi> for the <hi>matter</hi> of them, and yet, <hi>Every work of their Hands be unclean, faith the Lord. Plowing</hi> is Lawful, and <hi>Praying</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49234:5"/> is Lawful; and yet these <hi>works</hi> may be sinful in the Doer of them. Wherefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Manner</hi> of our <hi>Works,</hi> must be Right, as well as the <hi>Matter</hi> of them. A man may incur the Wrath of God, by his <hi>Good Works,</hi> if he do them not in any <hi>manner</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Law,</hi> as they should be done. We find, in 1 Chron. 15.13. <hi>The Lord our God</hi> is offended at those who <hi>Seek Him not after the due Order.</hi> No meer <hi>External Actions</hi> are to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed <hi>Good Works;</hi> there must <hi>Internal Cautions</hi> go along with them; else they are but the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Good Works,</hi> without the <hi>Form. Good Works</hi> must be done with <hi>Regular Circumstances,</hi> if they would be called, <hi>Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Design</hi> of our <hi>Works</hi> must be Right, as well as the <hi>manner</hi> of them. The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> of God has assigned for our <hi>Good Works,</hi> is, That the Great God, may be acknowledged, and magnified, and glorified: And the <hi>Gospel</hi> of God, coming in, has assigned a further <hi>Design</hi> for them; namely, To express our <hi>Gratitude</hi> unto our Lord-Redeemer, for His Redeeming of us. Thus 'tis Enjoined, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.30. <hi>Whatever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> An <hi>Evil Intention</hi> will utterly spoil any <hi>Good Works,</hi> tho' they were otherwise never so <hi>Good.</hi> And a meerly <hi>Selfish Intention</hi> is an <hi>Evil</hi> one. <hi>Good Works</hi> must all be done, with an Eye, to the <hi>Honour</hi> of God, and the <hi>Service</hi> of Christ, before any <hi>Temporal Advantage</hi> to <hi>Self:</hi> else the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49234:6"/>
                  <hi>Best Sacrifices</hi> are but an <hi>Abomination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Good Works</hi> must proceed from a <hi>Good <hi>Principle;</hi>
                  </hi> or otherwise they will have no <hi>Real Goodness</hi> in them. Waters that Flow from a bitter and a poison'd <hi>Fountain,</hi> can't be <hi>Good.</hi> A <hi>Good Heart,</hi> Like a <hi>Good Fountain,</hi> must be the <hi>Principle,</hi> from whence <hi>Good Works</hi> are to flow. We are told, in Mat. 12.35. <hi>A Good man, out of the Good Treasure of the Heart, bringeth forth Good Things.</hi> A <hi>Good Principle</hi> within, is a <hi>Good Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Heart. Works</hi> done meerly from a Principle of <hi>Slavish Fear,</hi> or <hi>Fleshly Love,</hi> are not <hi>Good,</hi> tho' they be never so <hi>Good.</hi> There must be a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Respect unto God in Christ,</hi> woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us unto all our <hi>Good Works,</hi> or else they are <hi>Stark Naught.</hi> Yea, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, must be in us, as a <hi>Vital Principle,</hi> for our <hi>Good Works,</hi> or else they are <hi>Dead Works,</hi> every one of them. Hence, no <hi>Good Works</hi> were ever done by any one <hi>Unregenerate</hi> man, since the World began; for every <hi>Unregenerate</hi> man is destitute of the <hi>Principle,</hi> which is to be acted in them: the most <hi>Splendid Works</hi> of the Unregenerate, are but (as <hi>Austin</hi> call'd them) <hi>Splendid Sins</hi> before the Lord.</p>
               <p>And now there is a Second <hi>Case</hi> which a Christian has to consider, that so he may be stirred up, and helped on, to do those <hi>Good Works</hi> by which he may approve himself indeed a Christian.</p>

               <p>Now we do know this; That our <hi>Good Works</hi> are not <hi>Antecedently</hi> necessary unto our <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> before the God of Heaven. For <hi>Good VVorks</hi> cannot be done by any man, <hi>until</hi> he be <hi>Justified.</hi> Until a man be <hi>United</hi> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our <hi>Life,</hi> he is a <hi>Dead man:</hi> and what <hi>Good Works</hi> can a <hi>Dead man</hi> do? This is a thing <hi>Livelily</hi> Preached unto us, by our Lord Himself, in the fifteenth Chapter of <hi>John; The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</hi> Hence that common saying of <hi>Austin, Bona Opera sequuntur Justificatum, non praecedunt Justificandum.</hi> No, nor is <hi>Faith</hi> it self, <hi>As</hi> doing of <hi>Good Works,</hi> that which Entitles us unto the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, for our <hi>Justification;</hi> 'Tis <hi>Faith,</hi> only <hi>As</hi> it Layes Hold on the <hi>Righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the chief of Sinners,</hi> that <hi>Justifies</hi> us; And until this be done, we cannot be carried forth unto any <hi>Good Works</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>But then, <hi>Good Works,</hi> are <hi>consequently</hi> necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon our <hi>Justification.</hi> 'Tis indeed said, That <hi>God Justifies the Ungodly;</hi> but then, He does not Leave them <hi>Ungodly</hi> when He hath <hi>Justified</hi> them. Well, And where Lies the <hi>Necessity?</hi> Truly, if we would not be <hi>vain men,</hi> we must <hi>Know</hi> such Things as these.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49234:7"/>
               <p>First, <hi>Wilt thou know, O man?</hi> That it is in the very <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Iustifying Faith,</hi> to put a man upon the Doing of <hi>Good Works. Faith</hi> is a <hi>Purifier</hi> of the <hi>Heart:</hi> [Acts 15.9.] and so, it cannot but be a <hi>Purifier</hi> of the <hi>Life.</hi> The same <hi>Faith,</hi> which Embraces the Lord Jesus Christ, as a <hi>Priest,</hi> for <hi>Atonement,</hi> (and <hi>As</hi> doing this, it <hi>Justifies!</hi>) Embraces Him also, as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> &amp; as a <hi>King:</hi> Now this <hi>Prophet</hi> will <hi>Instruct,</hi> &amp; this <hi>King</hi> will <hi>Injoin,</hi> our doing of <hi>Good Works</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. A <hi>Justifying Faith,</hi> Receives Christ the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer,</hi> and the <hi>Intercessor;</hi> and in that Notion, it <hi>Justifies:</hi> But is this all? No, it also, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Col. 2.6. <hi>Receives Christ the Lord.</hi> Now <hi>Good Works</hi> are by that <hi>Lord</hi> Required. 'Tis no <hi>True Faith,</hi> which any man hath, if it be not for a <hi>whole Christ.</hi> The Devil said unto our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>What have we to do with thee, Thou Holy One?</hi> If a man would be concerned with our Lord Jesus Christ, only as a <hi>Merciful</hi> One, and a <hi>Gracious</hi> One, and not likewise as an <hi>Holy</hi> One, that man has no more <hi>Faith</hi> than a <hi>Devil! Justifying Faith</hi> is a <hi>Tree,</hi> which cannot but have the <hi>Good Fruits</hi> of <hi>Good Works</hi> growing upon it. It is the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God, that <hi>Creates,</hi> and that <hi>Bestows,</hi> a <hi>Justifying Faith,</hi> wherever it is; and that <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> cannot suffer any Soul, in which He dwells, to be wholly Remiss about the <hi>Good Works</hi> which are agreeable unto His <hi>Holiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefly; 'Tis in the very <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Saving
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49234:7"/> Faith</hi> to be a <hi>Working Faith.</hi> The Scriptures of Truth, assure us, in Gal. 5.6. <hi>Faith works, by Love.</hi> It was well said, therefore by <hi>John Hus, Ubi Bona Opera non apparent ad extra, ibi Fides non est ad intra: Faith</hi> is not <hi>within,</hi> if <hi>Good VVorks</hi> are not <hi>without. Faith</hi> must become <hi>visible,</hi> and (as hath been sometimes said) <hi>Incarnate,</hi> by <hi>Good VVorks</hi> upon it.</p>
               <p>Again; <hi>Wilt thou know, O man?</hi> That <hi>Good works</hi> are no <hi>Small part</hi> of the <hi>Great Salvation,</hi> which is the Hope and claim of all the <hi>Justified.</hi> Our Lord Jesus Christ hath <hi>Redeemed</hi> us by His Blood; What for? We are informed, in Tit. 2.14. <hi>To purify unto Himself, a peculiar People, zealous of Good works.</hi> The following words, <hi>Let no man despise thee, Calvin</hi> thinks them spoken to the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> because <hi>People</hi> often don't care to Hear of this; but it is a Thing to be <hi>spoken with all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> A main Thing, Bought for us by the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is, that we may be made Happy, by our Enjoying a <hi>Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi> of that <hi>Righteousness,</hi> in our own doing of <hi>Good works,</hi> wherein we shall be conformed unto His Exemple. The <hi>Doing of Good works</hi> is one main Thing, in that <hi>Blessedness,</hi> which our Lord Jesus Christ hath purchased for us, in His being made a <hi>Curse</hi> on our behalf: And a man ha's no True <hi>Faith</hi> in him, until he be thus perswaded! Very grand is the mistake of men, about <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Salvation</hi> is not meerly our <hi>Fruition</hi> of the <hi>Good Things</hi> reserved for us, in the unseen and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
